# Resources 

Intuit documentation is quite dated but still useful. 

- https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbdesktop/docs/develop/sample-applications-and-code
- https://github.com/IntuitDeveloper/QBXML_SDK_Samples/tree/64bitUpgrade/xmlfiles
- https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbdesktop/docs/api-reference/qbdesktop

The most useful aside from the sample qbxml is the guide.

Additionaly, the forums are actually somewhat active and quite useful:
